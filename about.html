            <br>
            <p>
                I do electronics projects such as hand-wired mechanical keyboards, D.I.Y electronic cicuits,<br> audio systems, and etc on my free time. 
                I currently study Information and Communication Technology (ICT)<br> so I'm also interested in computer programming, 3D animations, video editing, photo editing,<br> and so much more.
                I do have experience with repairing gadgets such as computers and smartphones because<br> at the age of 13 I start to tinker around with them and open them to see what they look like from the inside.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                That curiousity of mine led to me gaining a lot of knowledge when it comes to how electronic<br> and a few mechanical devices funtions from the inside and how each component works.<br>
                When I see a car, for example, I often imagine what it looks like from the inside,<br> how the enginespistons moves up and down, how the transmission's gears work together to<br> propel the car, and etc.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also have a huge passion for music, I like listening to music and also playing a few music<br> instruments such as bass guitar, electric guitar, drums, and ukulele.
                Music helps me put my thoughts together<br> and really influence my mood whether if I feel like listening to upbeat music whenever I feel happy<br> or listen to electronic music to help me energize over what tasks I have ahead of me.
